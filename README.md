# Torque2Pixels: Time Series Anomaly Detection & Clustering for Wire Cutting

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying anomalies in a wire-cutting process for electric motor manufacturing at Bosch. It utilizes advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to transform torque-time data into visual representations for deep learning-based classification.

## Key Features:
- Time series data analysis using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
- Feature extraction via wavelet scalograms and spectrograms
- Deep learning classification using ResNet50 architecture
- Unsupervised clustering with K-Means and Mean Shift algorithms
- Anomaly detection in industrial cutting processes

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- Librosa (for audio processing techniques applied to time series data)

This repository contains the code, data preprocessing pipelines, model architectures, and analysis scripts used in the project. It serves as a comprehensive resource for time series analysis and anomaly detection in industrial processes.

## Future Work:
- Implement ensemble methods for multi-phase anomaly detection
- Explore advanced neural network architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers)
- Optimize feature extraction for different phases of the cutting process
